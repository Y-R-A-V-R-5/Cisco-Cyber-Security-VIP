# Cisco Cyber Security VIP 2023

## Project Overview

The **Cisco Cyber Security VIP 2023** project focuses on designing and securing an office network environment with Cisco security devices and best practices. The solution integrates **Cisco ASA Firewalls**, **VPN**, **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**, and **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)** to protect critical infrastructure, secure remote access, and ensure network resilience against cyber threats.

## Key Features

### 1. **Cisco ASA Firewalls**
   - **ASA1**: Acts as the primary firewall at the internet gateway, filtering traffic, and providing **VPN** access.
   - **ASA2**: Deployed in the **Server Room** to protect critical servers from unauthorized access and external threats.

### 2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Divides the network into isolated segments (DMZ, Server Room, Internal Network) to limit the spread of attacks.
   - **DMZ**: Isolated zone for hosting public-facing services like web servers.
   - **Internal Network**: Segments like Principal's Room, Computer Department, and Office reduce risk by containing potential breaches.

### 3. **Secure Remote Access**
   - Configured **VPN** tunnels with **MFA** to provide secure remote access for authorized users.

### 4. **Intrusion Prevention & Web Application Firewall**
   - **IPS**: Monitors and blocks malicious traffic in real-time.
   - **WAF**: Protects public-facing web servers from web-based attacks like **SQL injection** and **XSS**.

### 5. **Identity-Based Access Control**
   - **RBAC** ensures users only access resources relevant to their roles, enhancing security and minimizing risk.

### 6. **Centralized Security Management**
   - **Cisco Security Manager** provides centralized management of security policies and real-time monitoring across ASA devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Cisco ASA Firewalls**
- **VPN** Configuration & **MFA** Integration
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Endpoint Security**
- **Cisco Security Manager**

## Conclusion

This project implements a robust network security architecture using **Cisco ASA** devices, combining advanced firewall features, segmentation, and secure remote access to protect sensitive data and critical infrastructure. It ensures network security through proactive measures like **IPS**, **WAF**, and centralized management.
